/*
What number's bigger?

Write a function named greaterNum that:
- takes 2 arguments, both numbers.
- returns whichever number is the greater (higher) number.

Call that function 2 times with different number pairs,
and log the output to make sure it works (e.g. "The greater number of 5 and 10 is 10.").
*/

// write your solution here...
function greaterNum(num1, num2) {
  var greaterNum = Math.max(num1, num2);
  console.log("The greater number of " + num1 + " and " + num2 + " is " + greaterNum + ".");
}

greaterNum(13, 14);
greaterNum(29, 3);
